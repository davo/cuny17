12.99,5.97,"ok so what we're going to do is hop on"
15.929,4.711,"over to our styles that CSS and they get"
18.96,5.88,"rid of this comment i wrote it last time"
20.64,6.6,"and so the basic CSS syntax is it goes"
24.84,5.609,"something that you're going to style"
27.24,7.35,"let's say an h1 and then it goes"
30.449,7.261,"brackets and then you're going to have a"
34.59,6.3,"property a property could be you know"
37.71,6.15,"its color its background its text"
40.89,9.239,"decoration so to say okay let's say a"
43.86,9.15,"color would be its property so color and"
50.129,7.351,then we're going to have a colon and
53.01,8.7,"then a value so for color values that"
57.48,7.53,"might work and it's sort of blue green"
61.71,6.81,"yellow CSS has a bunch of basic colors"
65.01,6.84,"you can also use hex colors so if you"
68.52,9.45,"have a hex value you can do pound and"
71.85,8.1,"then 555555 for a gray so let's actually"
77.97,5.85,"just write this blue because it's"
79.95,6.87,"obnoxious and it's loud okay so this is"
83.82,6.63,"your entire line of CSS this is pretty"
86.82,7.38,"much what it's going to look like h1 the"
90.45,5.79,color of it is blue and a lot of times
94.2,4.26,people write CSS in different ways some
96.24,4.83,"people write out a line and you can just"
98.46,9.449,"add another one here you could say the"
101.07,7.86,"font size is 12 pixels so you could"
107.909,2.611,write it like this
108.93,3.719,"however i would personally recommend"
110.52,3.779,"doing it a little bit different and it's"
112.649,4.08,pretty easy to read
114.299,4.771,"so you space it out like this you have"
116.729,6.301,"your bracket here your bracket here and"
119.07,5.64,"then you can have your properties here i"
123.03,5.099,"think this is the easiest way to read"
124.71,5.249,"CSS but someone else's CSS I think it's"
128.129,4.051,"easier to go into a documented so to see"
129.959,3.571,"and know exactly what you're you know to"
132.18,3.75,expect if you see this
133.53,3.42,"when it's all in one line maybe not so"
135.93,2.82,much it might be a little bit more
136.95,4.29,difficult but that said everybody has
138.75,4.14,different ways of writing your CSS and
141.24,4.59,if you're the only person that's ever
142.89,4.77,"going to be seeing the CSS that i may be"
145.83,4.29,"doing how you want but I would stress to"
147.66,3.99,"sort of do it away that if anybody is"
150.12,4.71,"going to go into your code they can sort"
151.65,6.63,"of know what's going on ok so this is"
154.83,7.17,"the basic CSS syntax notice how i have"
158.28,5.31,"h1 here you can also pretty much do"
162,5.94,"anything if you have like a paragraph"
163.59,9.81,"would be Appy list item"
167.94,9.39,"b li let's say you want to target a"
173.4,7.02,"particular paragraph let's actually copy"
177.33,5.189,"this paragraph here i'm gonna make a"
180.42,9.87,"second one is going to make this"
182.519,10.351,"obnoxious text but she goes okay and and"
190.29,9.509,"here i want to only style this yo one if"
192.87,14.339,"i give this P let's say a color of red"
199.799,9.601,"and then i'm going to go to my HTML to"
207.209,5.401,"refresh it you see that both our"
209.4,6.149,"paragraph tags are read okay we only"
212.61,5.34,"want this yo-yo so it's a good way to do"
215.549,5.25,that is to give this paragraph at class
217.95,4.11,"so what does give this class of and"
220.799,6.331,"we're just going to have this being"
222.06,7.17,"alert so now this is a class of alert we"
227.13,5.94,"want all of the paragraphs that are"
229.23,8.099,"alert we want those to be red so you can"
233.07,5.88,"do is you can do dot alert so now it's"
237.329,3.571,going to be only looking for the class
238.95,5.19,"alert and it's going to color those"
240.9,6.66,"things red let's go back to our CSS our"
244.14,4.53,"HTML we refresh it and yo is the only"
247.56,5.01,"one that's red"
248.67,6.75,"cool what if he only wanted paragraph"
252.57,5.759,"tags with the class alert to be read"
255.42,7.08,let's say on this h1 we give this a
258.329,6.84,"class of alert as well what's going to"
262.5,4.169,"happen here if this h1 also has a class"
265.169,1.861,"of alert what it's going to do is it's"
266.669,2.491,"going"
267.03,3.63,"first read this h1 and it's going to"
269.16,5.88,"give it a color blue but it's going to"
270.66,6.81,"see this this thing has a color alert I"
275.04,5.22,"guess I should be red so let's go to"
277.47,4.47,HTML refresh this and now you can see
280.26,4.32,it's actually right even though we told
281.94,5.16,"it to be blue it's going to say oh the"
284.58,4.05,"alert is red"
287.1,4.319,"well let's say you only want to target"
288.63,6.93,"paragraph tags that are red you would"
291.419,6.211,"type p dot alert so now it's going to"
295.56,4.92,ignore everything except for paragraph
297.63,7.53,tags that are with the class of alert
300.48,6.93,"awesome so this is the basic CSS syntax"
305.16,4.74,"you can Kiev all sorts of stuff you can"
307.41,8.04,"Kiev the tag you can keep up the class"
309.9,8.01,"you can kyo off an ID by doing pound i"
315.45,4.95,"would recommend using classes two key"
317.91,4.2,"off of and then sometimes you're going"
320.4,3.63,"to want to say all H ones are this way"
322.11,3.27,"all h2 this way in fact i would"
324.03,3.78,recommend doing it that way
325.38,5.52,"in fact CSS follows a philosophy of"
327.81,5.46,"don't repeat yourself so let's say you"
330.9,5.88,have a couple of different paragraphs we
333.27,5.459,have this alert paragraph and we have
336.78,4.92,just a normal
338.729,4.921,let's say we'll just call this a yes
341.7,9.9,"paragraph and then i'll go ahead and"
343.65,10.47,give this other one a class of yes
351.6,5.52,"so let's say we want all of the"
354.12,8.19,paragraphs on our site to have a font
357.12,8.46,"size of 24 pixels what you don't want to"
362.31,5.97,"do is say okay this the P alert in the"
365.58,5.01,"PS those both have a font size of 20 pic"
368.28,4.77,"24 pixels because if you noticed we've"
370.59,7.2,"just run this code twice and sure enough"
373.05,7.59,"they're both 24 pixels but the smart"
377.79,4.83,"thing to do here if all of your"
380.64,4.53,paragraph tags on your site are going to
382.62,9.36,"be that size we just have a paragraph"
385.17,9.18,"font size 24 pixels now we'll come back"
391.98,3.9,here refresh and it nothing happens
394.35,4.92,because it's the same
395.88,4.32,"ok so don't repeat yourself and CSS it's"
399.27,3.3,something that we're going to be talking
400.2,4.26,"a lot more so don't worry about it we'll"
402.57,5.13,"come back to it all the time but this is"
404.46,4.71,"the basic CSS syntax and now you know"
