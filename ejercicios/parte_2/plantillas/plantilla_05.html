                <p>Fox News host Bill O’Reilly announced on Tuesday that he was taking a vacation to an unspecified location, effective immediately — a move that comes as dozens of advertisers flee his program, The O’Reilly Factor, over accusations of sexual misconduct.</p>
                <p>O’Reilly framed the break as consistent with what he has done every spring. "Often around this time of year, I grab some vacation because it’s spring and Easter time,” he said on Tuesday’s show, claiming that he booked the trip in the fall. A Fox spokesperson said that O’Reilly will return on April 24.</p>
                <p>Lisa Bloom, the attorney for Wendy Walsh, a psychologist and radio host who alleges that in 2013 O’Reilly withdrew an offer to be a Fox contributor after she rebuffed his sexual advances, does not buy that explanation. “I have no reason to believe the vacation is real, and every reason to believe it's a cover,” Bloom told The Outline.</p>
